# Cash Record Application Using IndexedDB

Hello everyone, this project was developed during my university years for the "Basic Web Design" course.


This application provides simple bookkeeping functionality, allowing users not only to view records of expenses but also to modify and delete entries.

The tools used for developing this application primarily include Bootstrap for the frontend and IndexedDB and jQuery for the backend.

In the future, I plan to deploy this application to my website (http://ggrstwebsite.com).
